# Identity Verification App
# Overview
This Android application is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for identity verification. The app utilizes advanced image processing and AI technologies to ensure that personal identification is authenticated efficiently.

# Features
Welcome Screen: A user-friendly entry point that greets users and introduces the app's functionalities.
ID Document Verification: Users are prompted to capture images of their identification documents. The app then uses image processing algorithms to verify the authenticity and validity of the documents.
Photo Capture for Validation: The app guides the user to take a photo of their ID in various positions (front, back) ensuring that all relevant information is captured for processing.
Facial Recognition for Biometric Validation: By accessing the device's camera, users can take a selfie which the app compares to the photo ID for biometric verification. This step employs facial recognition technology to ensure the user's identity matches the document provided.
Verification Process Indicators: The app includes clear indicators of the verification process, informing the user of the current step and what is required next.
Result Confirmation: After processing the ID document and biometric data, the app displays the outcome, confirming whether the verification was successful or not.
